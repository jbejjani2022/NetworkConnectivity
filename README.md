# Understanding Network Connectivity: A Linear Algebra Approach to Graph Theory   

A 28-page paper detailing mathematical techniques for network analysis.
Applied the techniques using Python to analyze the connectivity of a collaboration 
network of 198 jazz musicians with 2,742 edges.

The network datasets in this repo were obtained from http://konect.cc and http://www.cise.ufl.edu.
